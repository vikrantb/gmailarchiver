# Gmail Archiver

The **Gmail Archiver** tool is a Python utility designed for downloading and archiving emails from a specified Gmail account. This tool organizes emails by year and month, compresses them into `.zip` files for each month, and optionally deletes archived emails from the Gmail account to manage inbox space.

---

## Features

- **Download and Archive Emails**: Downloads emails before a specified cutoff date, organizing them by year and month.
- **Automatic Compression**: Archives are saved in `.zip` format, structured as `year/month.zip`.
- **Inbox Management**: Optionally delete emails from Gmail after archiving.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Allows setting parameters like the archive path, cutoff date, and maximum parallelization for efficient downloading.
- **Multi-threaded Execution**: Supports configurable parallelization to speed up the email download process.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Google API Client Library for Python (`google-auth`, `google-auth-oauthlib`, `google-auth-httplib2`, `google-api-python-client`)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gmail_archiver.git
   cd gmail_archiver
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up Google API Credentials**:
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a project, and enable the Gmail API.
   - Download the `credentials.json` file and save it in the `gmail_archiver` directory.

## Usage

### Running the Archiver Tool

Run the `gmail_archiver.py` script with the following command:

```bash
python gmail_archiver.py
```

Upon running, the tool will prompt you for the following information:

1. **Base Path for Archive**: The path where the emails will be saved. If not specified, it defaults to `./gmail_archives`.
2. **Cutoff Date**: Specify the cutoff date (in `MM-DD-YYYY` format) to download emails older than this date.
3. **Delete Emails After Archiving**: Confirm if you'd like to delete the emails from Gmail after archiving. Type "yes" to confirm.

### Example

Hereâ€™s a sample run showing the inputs and outputs:

```bash
$ python gmail_archiver.py

Enter the base path for saving email archives (or press Enter for default ./gmail_archives):
Enter the cutoff date for archiving (MM-DD-YYYY): 01-01-2022
Do you want to delete emails from Gmail after archiving? (yes/no): yes
```

This command downloads and archives emails from before January 1, 2022, saving them in `gmail_archives` and deleting them from Gmail after successful archiving.

## Configuration Parameters

You can adjust parameters directly in `gmail_archiver.py`:

- **MAX_WORKERS**: Sets the maximum number of concurrent threads for faster downloads.
- **Log File**: The `processed.log` file in the archive directory keeps track of archived months, allowing for resumable runs.

---

## Notes

- **Token Storage**: This tool uses a `token.json` file to store Google OAuth tokens, allowing it to access Gmail without re-authentication.
- **Compression Size Limit**: Monthly archives smaller than 500 KB are deleted automatically to save space.
- **Logging**: Processed months are logged to avoid redundant downloads on subsequent runs.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Errors**: Ensure `credentials.json` exists in the same directory. Delete `token.json` if re-authentication is required.
- **Rate Limits**: If the tool hits Gmail API rate limits, it will retry automatically but may require manual intervention if persistent.
