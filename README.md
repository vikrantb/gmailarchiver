#### Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console Project Creation page](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate).
2. If you already have a project, skip to **Step 3.3**. Otherwise, create a new project by:
   - Entering a **Project Name**.
   - Selecting **No organization** (if applicable).
3. Click **Create** to finish creating your project.

#### Enable the Gmail API for Your Project

1. Navigate to the **Enable API and Services** page for the Gmail API by clicking [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/enableflow?apiid=gmail.googleapis.com).
2. Ensure the correct project is selected in the top navigation bar.
3. Click **Enable** to activate the Gmail API for your project.

#### Set Up OAuth Consent

1. Go to the [OAuth consent screen setup](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials/consent) for your project.
2. If no app exists, create one by entering the necessary details, such as your app name and email.
3. Ensure the following **OAuth Scopes** are listed and have access:
   - **Gmail API**: `https://mail.google.com/` - Read, compose, send, and permanently delete all your email from Gmail.
   - **Gmail API**: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify` - Read, compose, and send emails from your Gmail account.
4. If you are just using the app for yourself (not for public use), set the **Publishing Status** of the app to **Testing** on the first screen. For broader access, you'll need to submit the app for verification, which may take up to a day.

#### Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. Go to the [API Credentials page](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) in Google Cloud Console.
2. Select your project from the drop-down menu if itâ€™s not already selected.
3. If there are no existing credentials, create new ones:
   - Click **Create Credentials** and select **OAuth client ID**.
   - For **Application type**, choose **Desktop app**.
   - Name your credentials (e.g., "Gmail Archiver Credentials") and click **Create**.
4. A dialog will appear with the **OAuth Client ID**. Click **Download JSON** to save the `credentials.json` file.

#### Save the Credentials File

1. Download the `credentials.json` file to your local machine.
2. Move the downloaded file to the directory where the Gmail Archiver script is located (e.g., `gmail_archiver/`).
3. Rename the file to `credentials.json`.

#### Verify Setup

With these examples, you can see the versatility of the Gmail Archiver tool to manage and organize your Gmail data effectively! ðŸ“¨


Here are several sample commands with explanations for running `gmail_archiver.py` with different configurations:

1. **Basic Archiving with Default Settings**

   ```bash
   $ python gmail_archiver.py
   ```

   This command will prompt you interactively to:
   - Specify a base path for saving email archives (default: `./gmail_archives`).
   - Enter a cutoff date for archiving (e.g., `MM-DD-YYYY`).
   - Choose whether to delete emails from Gmail after archiving (type `yes` or `no`).

   The script will download and archive emails, saving them in the specified base path and optionally deleting them from Gmail.

---

2. **Archiving Emails in a Specific Date Range**

   ```bash
   $ python gmail_archiver.py --start-date 12-31-2004 --end-date 12-31-2005 --base-path "gmail_backup"
   ```

   - `--start-date`: Sets the start date for emails to be archived (`12-31-2004`).
   - `--end-date`: Sets the end date for emails to be archived (`12-31-2005`).
   - `--base-path`: Specifies the directory to store the archived emails (`gmail_backup`).

   This command archives emails from December 31, 2004, to December 31, 2005, and saves them in the `gmail_backup` directory. 

---

3. **Archiving with Deletion Enabled**

   ```bash
   $ python gmail_archiver.py --start-date 01-01-2020 --end-date 12-31-2020 --base-path "2020_archive" --delete
   ```

   - `--start-date`: Archives emails starting from January 1, 2020.
   - `--end-date`: Archives emails up to December 31, 2020.
   - `--base-path`: Sets the archive folder to `2020_archive`.
   - `--delete`: Deletes archived emails from Gmail after successful download.

   This command archives all emails from the year 2020 and removes them from Gmail once archived.

---

4. **Specifying a Custom Number of Threads**

   ```bash
   $ python gmail_archiver.py --start-date 01-01-2019 --end-date 12-31-2019 --threads 20
   ```

   - `--threads`: Sets the number of threads for processing emails concurrently (`20`).

   This command archives emails for the year 2019 with a custom setting of `20` threads for concurrent processing, which may speed up the archiving process on systems with sufficient resources.

---

5. **Setting a High Retry Count for Rate-Limiting Issues**

   ```bash
   $ python gmail_archiver.py --start-date 01-01-2018 --end-date 12-31-2018 --retries 10
   ```

   - `--retries`: Specifies the maximum number of retries if rate limits are encountered (`10`).

   This command archives emails for the year 2018 and allows up to `10` retries per email if rate limits are hit, making it more resilient in case of throttling.

---

6. **Combining Multiple Options**

   ```bash
   $ python gmail_archiver.py --start-date 01-01-2015 --end-date 12-31-2016 --base-path "2015_2016_backup" --delete --threads 15 --retries 7
   ```

   - Combines `--start-date`, `--end-date`, `--base-path`, `--delete`, `--threads`, and `--retries`.

   This command:
   - Archives emails from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2016.
   - Saves them to `2015_2016_backup`.
   - Deletes emails from Gmail after archiving.
   - Uses `15` threads for concurrent processing.
   - Sets `7` retries in case of rate-limiting.

   This configuration is suitable for handling a large volume of emails efficiently with resiliency against rate-limiting.

---

## Configuration Parameters

You can adjust parameters directly in `gmail_archiver.py`:

- **MAX_WORKERS**: Sets the maximum number of concurrent threads for faster downloads.
- **Log File**: The `processed.log` file in the archive directory keeps track of archived months, allowing for resumable runs.

---

## Notes

- **Token Storage**: This tool uses a `token.json` file to store Google OAuth tokens, allowing it to access Gmail without re-authentication.
- **Compression Size Limit**: Monthly archives smaller than 500 KB are deleted automatically to save space.
- **Logging**: Processed months are logged to avoid redundant downloads on subsequent runs.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Errors**: Ensure `credentials.json` exists in the same directory. Delete `token.json` if re-authentication is required.
- **Rate Limits**: If the tool hits Gmail API rate limits, it will retry automatically but may require manual intervention if persistent.
